# FireHydrant Provider

Welcome to the FireHydrant Terraform provider! With this provider you can create
and manage resources on your [FireHydrant](https://www.firehydrant.com) organization
such as incident runbooks, services, teams, and more!

Use the navigation on the left to read about the available resources and data sources.

~> **Note** This provider is still at version zero. To make sure that new versions with 
potentially breaking changes will not be automatically installed, you should 
[constrain the acceptable provider versions](https://www.terraform.io/language/providers/requirements#version-constraints) 
on the minor version.

    }
  }
}

# Configure a FireHydrant priority
resource "firehydrant_priority" "example-priority" {
