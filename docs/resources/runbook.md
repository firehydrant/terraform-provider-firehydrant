# firehydrant_runbook Resource

FireHydrant runbooks allow you to configure and automate your incident response process by defining a workflow
to be followed when an incident occurs. Runbooks actually initiate actions that are fundamental steps to
resolving an incident. Such actions might be creating a Slack channel, starting a Zoom meeting, or opening
a Jira ticket. Think of a runbook as an incident response playbook that runs (or is activated) when
an incident is declared. Using runbooks, you can equip your team with updated information and best practices
for mitigating incidents.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:
```hcl
resource "firehydrant_team" "example-owner-team" {
  name        = "my-example-owner-team"
  description = "This is an example team that owns a runbook"
}

data "firehydrant_runbook_action" "notify-channel-action" {
  slug             = "notify_channel"
  integration_slug = "slack"
  type             = "incident"
}

resource "firehydrant_runbook" "example-runbook" {
  name        = "example-runbook"
  type        = "incident"
  description = "This is an example runbook"
  owner_id    = firehydrant_team.example-owner-team.id

  steps {
    name                    = "Notify Channel"
    action_id               = data.firehydrant_runbook_action.notify-channel-action.id
    action_integration_slug = data.firehydrant_runbook_action.notify-channel-action.integration_slug
    action_slug             = data.firehydrant_runbook_action.notify-channel-action.slug
