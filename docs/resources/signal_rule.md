# firehydrant_signal_rule Resource

FireHydrant signal rules are used to convert incoming events into outbound alerts sent to a specified destination.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:
```hcl
data "firehydrant_user" "my-user" {
  email = "example@firehydrant.io"
}

resource "firehydrant_team" "example-team" {
  name        = "example-team"
  description = "This is an example team"

  memberships {
    user_id          = data.firehydrant_user.my-user.id
  }
}

resource "firehydrant_signal_rule" "datadog_source" {
  team_id = firehydrant_team.example-team.id
  name = "Datadog Source"
  expression = "signal.summary.contains(\"[Triggered]\")"
  target_type = "EscalationPolicy"
  target_id = firehydrant_escalation_policy.default_policy.id
  create_incident_condition_when = "WHEN_ALWAYS"
  deduplication_expiry = "PT30M"
  notification_priority_override = "HIGH"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `notification_priority_override` - (Optional) The priority to assign to notifications generated by this rule. Valid values are `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, and `HIGH`. Defaults to `HIGH`.
* `create_incident_condition_when` - (Optional) When to create an incident. Valid values are `WHEN_UNSPECIFIED` and `WHEN_ALWAYS`.
* `deduplication_expiry` - (Optional) Duration for deduplicating similar alerts in ISO8601 duration format (e.g., `PT30M`, `PT2H`, `P1D`).

* `target_team_id` - The team ID associated with the target (for escalation policies and teams).
* `target_is_pageable` - Whether the target is pageable.

## Import

Signal rules can be imported; use `<TeamID>:<SignalRuleID>` as the import ID. For example:

```shell
terraform import firehydrant_signal_rule.example_rule 3638b647-b99c-5051-b715-eda2c912c42e:12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef
