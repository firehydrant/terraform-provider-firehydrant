# firehydrant_rotation Resource

FireHydrant rotations, along with on call schedules, are used to define who is on-call for a given time period.  Note that the schedule resource will create one rotation by default and additional rotations must be associated with a schedule id as well as a team id.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:
```hcl
data "firehydrant_user" "my-user-1" {
  email = "user1@example.com"
}

data "firehydrant_user" "my-user-2" {
  email = "user2@example.com"
}

data "firehydrant_team" "example-team" {
  id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}

data "firehydrant_on_call_schedule" "example-schedule" {
  id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}

resource "firehydrant_rotation" "new-rotation" {
  name        = "My New On-call Rotation"
  description = "This is an example on-call schedule rotation"
  team_id     = data.firehydrant_team.example-team.id
  schedule_id = data.firehydrant_on_call_schedule.example-schedule.id

  members = [
    data.firehydrant_user.my-user-1.id,
    data.firehydrant_user.my-user-2.id,
  ]

  time_zone                          = "America/New_York"
  slack_user_group_id                = "S01JBG0RHUM"
  enable_slack_channel_notifications = true
  prevent_shift_deletion             = true
  coverage_gap_notification_interval = "P1H30M"

  strategy {
    type         = "weekly"
    handoff_time = "10:00:00"
    handoff_day  = "thursday"
  }

  restrictions {
    start_day = "monday"
    end_day = "monday"
    start_time = "10:00:00"
    end_time = "14:00:00"
  }

  restrictions {
    start_day = "tuesday"
    end_day = "tuesday"
    start_time = "12:00:00"
    end_time = "23:00:00"
  }
}
```
