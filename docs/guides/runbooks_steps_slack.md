# Slack

~> **Note** You must have the Slack integration installed in FireHydrant
for any Slack runbook steps to work properly.

The FireHydrant Slack integration allows users to interact with FireHydrant
through Slack. This allows your engineers to stay in Slack while
still leveraging all the automation FireHydrant provides.

### Available Steps

* [Add a Bookmark to Incident Channel](#add-a-bookmark-to-incident-channel)
* [Archive Incident Channel](#archive-incident-channel)
* [Create Incident Channel](#create-incident-channel)
* [Notify Channel](#notify-channel)
* [Notify Channel With a Custom Message](#notify-channel-with-a-custom-message)
* [Notify Incident Channel With a Custom Message](#notify-incident-channel-with-a-custom-message)

## Add a Bookmark to Incident Channel

The Slack **Add a Bookmark to Incident Channel** step
allows FireHydrant users to automatically add a bookmark to the incident channel.

### Add a Bookmark to Incident Channel - Example Usage

Basic usage:
```hcl
data "firehydrant_runbook_action" "slack_add_bookmark_to_incident_channel" {
  integration_slug = "slack"
  slug             = "add_bookmark_to_incident_channel"
}

resource "firehydrant_runbook" "slack_add_bookmark_to_incident_channel_runbook" {
  name = "slack-add-bookmark-to-incident-channel-runbook"

  steps {
    name      = "Add Bookmark to Slack Incident Channel"
    action_id = data.firehydrant_runbook_action.slack_add_bookmark_to_incident_channel.id

    config = jsonencode({
      bookmark_link  = "https://example.com"
      bookmark_title = "Service Dashboard"
    })
    
    automatic = true
  }
}
```

### Add a Bookmark to Incident Channel - Steps Argument Reference

* `action_id` - (Required) The ID of the runbook action for the step.
* `config` - (Required) JSON string representing the configuration settings for the step.
  Use [Terraform's jsonencode](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/jsonencode)

* `name` - (Required) The name of the step.
* `automatic` - (Optional) Whether this step should automatically execute.
* `rule` - (Optional) JSON string representing the rule configuration for the runbook step.
  For more information on the conditional logic used in `rule`, see the
  [Runbooks - Conditional Logic](./runbooks_conditional_logic.md) documentation.
  The step will default to running manually if `rule` is not specified and `automatic` and `repeats` are both `false`.

The `config` block supports:

* `bookmark_link` - (optional) The bookmark link.
* `bookmark_title` - (optional) A title for the bookmark.

## Archive Incident Channel

The Slack **Archive Incident Channel** step
allows FireHydrant users to automatically archive the incident channel
after an incident is over.
