# PagerDuty

~> **Note** You must have the PagerDuty integration installed in FireHydrant
for any PagerDuty runbook steps to work properly.

The FireHydrant PagerDuty integration allows FireHydrant users to link incidents
in PagerDuty to incidents in FireHydrant.

### Available Steps

* [Create PagerDuty Incident](#create-pagerduty-incident)

## Create PagerDuty Incident

The [PagerDuty **Create PagerDuty Incident** step](https://support.firehydrant.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057722212-Starting-a-PagerDuty-Incident)
allows FireHydrant users to create a new PagerDuty incident from a FireHydrant incident.

### Create PagerDuty Incident - Example Usage

Basic usage:
```hcl
data "firehydrant_runbook_action" "pagerduty_create_new_incident" {
  integration_slug = "pager_duty"
  slug             = "create_new_pager_duty_incident"
}

resource "firehydrant_runbook" "pagerduty_create_new_incident_runbook" {
  name = "pagerduty-create-new-incident-runbook"

  steps {
    name      = "Create PagerDuty Incident"
    action_id = data.firehydrant_runbook_action.pagerduty_create_new_incident.id

    config = jsonencode({
      incident_title   = "{{incident.severity}} Incident: {{incident.name}}"
      incident_details = "There is a {{incident.severity}} incident.\n\nTriggered by {{author.name}} from FireHydrant. For more information see {{incident.incident_url}}."

      escalation_policy_id = {
        label = "Registration Team Escalation Policy"
        value = "xxxxxxx"
      }
      incident_creator = {
        label = "user@example.com"
        value = "user@example.com"
      }
      service_id = {
        label = "Registration Service"
        value = "xxxxxxx"
      }
    })

    automatic = true
  }
}
```

### Create PagerDuty Incident - Steps Argument Reference

* `action_id` - (Required) The ID of the runbook action for the step.
* `config` - (Required) JSON string representing the configuration settings for the step.
  Use [Terraform's jsonencode](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/jsonencode)
