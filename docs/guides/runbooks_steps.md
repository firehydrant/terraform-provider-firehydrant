# Overview

FireHydrant runbooks allow you to configure and automate your incident response process by defining a workflow
to be followed when an incident occurs. Runbooks actually initiate actions that are fundamental steps to
resolving an incident. Such actions might be creating a Slack channel, starting a Zoom meeting, or opening
a Jira ticket. These actions are defined as steps in runbooks and each type of step requires different 
configuration. FireHydrant has a number of integrations, each with different possible steps you can add 
to your runbook.
