## Create a Zoom Meeting

The [Zoom **Create a Zoom Meeting** step](https://support.firehydrant.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058202271-Zoom-Integration)
allows FireHydrant users to create Zoom meetings.

Basic usage:
```hcl
data "firehydrant_runbook_action" "zoom_create_meeting" {
  integration_slug = "zoom"
  slug             = "create_meeting"
}

resource "firehydrant_runbook" "zoom_create_meeting_runbook" {
  name = "zoom-create-meeting-runbook"

  steps {
    name      = "Create Zoom Meeting"
    action_id = data.firehydrant_runbook_action.zoom_create_meeting.id
