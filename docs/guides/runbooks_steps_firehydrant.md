## Add Services Related to Functionality

The [FireHydrant **Add Services Related to Functionality** step](https://support.firehydrant.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409237309460-Auto-Adding-Services-Related-To-Functionality-)
allows all services related to a functionality to be automatically added to an incident, 
giving you assurance that the right teams and services will be associated with your incident 
no matter what.

### Add Services Related to Functionality - Example Usage

Basic usage:
```hcl
data "firehydrant_runbook_action" "firehydrant_add_services_related_to_functionality" {
  integration_slug = "patchy"
  slug             = "add_services_related_to_functionality"
}

resource "firehydrant_runbook" "firehydrant_add_services_related_to_functionality_runbook" {
  name        = "add-services-related-to-functionality-runbook"
  description = "This is an example configuration for a runbook that uses the FireHydrant add services related to functionality step"

  steps {
    name             = "Auto-Add Services Related To Functionality"
    action_id        = data.firehydrant_runbook_action.firehydrant_add_services_related_to_functionality.id
    automatic        = false
    repeats          = true
    repeats_duration = "PT15M"
  }
}
```

### Add Services Related to Functionality - Steps Argument Reference

* `action_id` - (Required) The ID of the runbook action for the step.
* `name` - (Required) The name of the step.
* `automatic` - (Optional) Whether this step should automatically execute.
* `repeats` - (Optional) Whether this step should repeat. Defaults to `false`.
  When this value is `true`, `repeats_duration` _must_ be provided.
* `repeats_duration` - (Optional) How often this step should repeat in ISO8601.
  Example: PT10M [Format Spec](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001437-13/reference/r_iso_8601_duration_format.htm)
  This value _must_ be provided if `repeats` is `true`. This value _must not_ be provided if `repeats` is `false`.
* `rule` - (Optional) JSON string representing the rule configuration for the runbook step.
  For more information on the conditional logic used in `rule`, see the
  [Runbooks - Conditional Logic](./runbooks_conditional_logic.md) documentation.
  The step will default to running manually if `rule` is not specified and `automatic` and `repeats` are both `false`.

## Add Task List

The FireHydrant **Add Task List** step allows 
[FireHydrant task lists](https://support.firehydrant.com/hc/en-us/articles/5505273345428-Task-lists)

## Publish to Status Page

The FireHydrant **Publish to Status Page** step allows your 
[FireHydrant status pages](https://support.firehydrant.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057722032-Status-Pages-Overview)
to be automatically updated during an incident.

### Publish to Status Page - Example Usage

Basic usage:
```hcl
data "firehydrant_runbook_action" "firehydrant_publish_to_status_page" {
  integration_slug = "nunc"
  slug             = "create_nunc"
}

resource "firehydrant_runbook" "firehydrant_publish_to_status_page_runbook" {
  name = "publish-to-status-page-runbook"

  steps {
    name      = "Publish to status page"
    action_id = data.firehydrant_runbook_action.firehydrant_publish_to_status_page.id

    config = jsonencode({
      title = "Example Incident #123"
      connection_id = {
        label = "status.firehydrant.com"
        value = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
      }
    })

    automatic = true
  }
}
```

### Publish to Statuspage - Steps Argument Reference

* `action_id` - (Required) The ID of the runbook action for the step.
* `config` - (Required) JSON string representing the configuration settings for the step.
  Use [Terraform's jsonencode](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/jsonencode)

* `name` - (Required) The name of the step.
* `automatic` - (Optional) Whether this step should automatically execute.
