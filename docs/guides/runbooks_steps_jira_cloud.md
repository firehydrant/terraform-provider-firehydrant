# Jira Cloud

~> **Note** You must have the Jira Cloud integration installed in FireHydrant
for any Jira Cloud runbook steps to work properly.

The FireHydrant Jira Cloud integration allows FireHydrant users to track all 
the actions proposed during an incident in their existing project management 
workflows for estimation and scheduling.

### Available Steps

* [Create Incident Issue](#create-incident-issue)

## Create Incident Issue

The [Jira Cloud **Create Incident Issue** step](https://support.firehydrant.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058202631-Creating-an-Incident-Ticket)
allows FireHydrant users to create a new Jira Cloud incident issue ticket at the start of an incident 
that will automatically sync all created action items and link them to a parent ticket.

### Create Incident Issue - Example Usage

Basic usage:
```hcl
data "firehydrant_runbook_action" "jira_cloud_create_incident_issue" {
  integration_slug = "jira_cloud"
  slug             = "create_incident_issue"
}

data "firehydrant_incident_role" "commander_incident_role" {
  id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}

resource "firehydrant_runbook" "jira_cloud_create_incident_issue_runbook" {
  name = "jira-cloud-create-incident-issue-runbook"

  steps {
    name      = "Create a Jira Cloud Issue"
    action_id = data.firehydrant_runbook_action.jira_cloud_create_incident_issue.id

    config = jsonencode({
      project = {
        label = "Platform Team Work"
        value = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
      }
      role_for_assignment = {
        label = data.firehydrant_incident_role.commander_incident_role.name
        value = data.firehydrant_incident_role.commander_incident_role.id
      }
      ticket_description = "{{ incident.description }}"
      ticket_summary     = "{{ incident.name }}"
    })
    
    automatic = true
  }
}
```

### Create Incident Issue - Steps Argument Reference

* `action_id` - (Required) The ID of the runbook action for the step.
* `config` - (Required) JSON string representing the configuration settings for the step.
  Use [Terraform's jsonencode](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/jsonencode)
  function so that [Terraform can guarantee valid JSON syntax](https://www.terraform.io/language/expressions/strings#generating-json-or-yaml).
* `name` - (Required) The name of the step.
* `automatic` - (Optional) Whether this step should automatically execute.
* `rule` - (Optional) JSON string representing the rule configuration for the runbook step.
  For more information on the conditional logic used in `rule`, see the
  [Runbooks - Conditional Logic](./runbooks_conditional_logic.md) documentation.
  The step will default to running manually if `rule` is not specified and `automatic` and `repeats` are both `false`.

The `config` block supports:

* `project` - (Required) The FireHydrant Jira Cloud ticketing project to create the incident issue ticket in.
